# Repository for NEURON Model of Striatal Projection Neurons

TThis repository contains a NEURON model of striatal projection neurons built on top of 'striatal_SPN_lib' created by Lindroos and Hellgren Kotaleski 2020:

    Lindroos R, Kotaleski JH. Predicting complex spikes in striatal projection neurons of the 
    direct pathway following neuromodulation by acetylcholine and dopamine. Eur J Neurosci. 2020.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- NEURON (tested on versions 8.1 and 8.2) [NEURON official website](https://www.neuron.yale.edu)
- Python (tested using version 3.9.16)

### Steps
1. **Install NEURON**:

Download from [NEURON official website](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download)

* Quickstart: https://www.neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/2019umn/neuron-quickstart.pdf

* (Old) Mac instructions: https://www.neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/nrn_mac_install.pdf
  

2. **Install Python**:

Follow the guide at [Python Installation](https://python-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starting/install3/osx.html)


## Running the Models

### Getting Started

1. **Install NEURON with python support** (see setup instructions)

2. **Open Terminal**:
   - On MacOS: Press `cmd + space` to open spotlight search and type 'terminal'.
   - On Linux: Search for terminal in your applications menu or press `ctrl + alt + T`.
   - On Windows: Search for command prompt or PowerShell in the start menu.

3. **Compile mechanisms**:

   Navigate to directory containing NEURON mechanisms.

   For instance if 'SPNfinal' is in documents folder in OS, mechanisms are located in cd/documents/SPNfinal/mechanisms/single

   Mechanisms are then compiled by entering 'nrnivmodl' or 'mknrndll'

   On MacOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   cd documents/SPNfinal/mechanisms/single
   nrnivmodl
   ```

   On Windows:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\documents\SPNfinal\mechanisms\single
   nrnivmodl
   ```

5. **Create a conda environment**

   There is a yaml file in the main directory called environment.yml.

   This can be used to create a conda environment called 'neuron'

   See notes below **Virtual Environments**

   Ensure make sure to navigate back to the main directory after step 3 above

   Check installed correctly using 'conda list'

   On MacOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   cd ../.. 
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda list
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```bash
   cd ..\.. 
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda list
   ```
   
6. **Quit Terminal**

   ```bash
   exit
   ```
   
### Running simulations in Jupyter Notebook

The following steps 1-4 must be every time a new Jupyter Notebook session is started

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - On MacOS: Press `cmd + space` to open spotlight search and type 'terminal'.
   - On Linux: Search for terminal in your applications menu or press `ctrl + alt + T`.
   - On Windows: Search for command prompt or PowerShell in the start menu.

2. **Activate conda environment 'neuron'**

   Navigate back to the main directory

   On MacOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   cd documents/SPNfinal
   conda activate neuron
   ```

   On Windows:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\documents\SPNfinal
   conda activate neuron
   ```
4. **Run Jupyter notebook**

   Add 'neuron' environment then open Jupyter Notebook

   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name neuron --display-name "Python (neuron)"
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Run a simulation**

   Jupyter Notebook should be open in the default browser

   Choose a Notebook to open (by clicking on any notebook - *.ipynb)

   Ensure kernel is set to Python 3 (ipykernel)

   From kernel dropdown menu choose 'Restart Run All' (if running again then it's good practice to run 'Restart and Clear Output' first)

   Code should run and generate raw data used to generate figures

   If option save = True in the Notebook then the raw figures and pickled data is stored in a subdirectory within the main one


## Data Analysis

The final analysis and figures used in the manuscript were made using R:
- R version 4.3.1 â€“ "Beagle Scouts"
- [R Statistical Software](https://www.R-project.org/)

Refer to the 'R analysis' directory for the code.

Each simulation has a unique identifier; for instance, Fig5_EF.ipynb is sim4. 

Once the Jupyter Notebook is executed with save = True, the outputs are stored automatically. 

In this case, raw trace data is stored as pickled files in the subdirectory dspn/model1/physiological/simulations/sim4; any images generated are found in dspn/model1/physiological/images/sim4

The R code to analyse the output from Fig5_EF.ipynb is found in Fig5_EF.R in the 'R analysis' directory.

In order to locate the raw data to recreate the final images for the ms it may be necessary to alter the line

On MacOS/Linux: 
    
    path <- paste0('/Documents/GitHub/SPNfinal/', spn, '/model', model, '/physiological/simulations/sim', sim,'/')

On Windows: 
    
    path <- paste0('C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Documents\\GitHub\\SPNfinal\\', spn, '\\model', model, '\\physiological\\simulations\\sim', sim, '\\')

This line should be the only one that it is necessary to change in order to execute the R code.


## Virtual Environments

The `environment.yml` file is configured for NEURON 8.2.1 and Python 3.9.16. Use this file to create a consistent environment for running the models.

In brief:     

* **YAML Environment File**: The file environment.yml is a YAML file commonly used in Conda

  This file specifies the dependencies and settings for a particular virtual environment.

* **Environment Name** - name Key: In the environment.yml file, there is a key called name.

  The value associated with this key is the name of the Conda environment to be created.

  In this case, this name is 'neuron'. This is the name that will subsequently be used

  to refer to the environment when activating it or installing additional packages into it.

* **Creating the Environment**: When the command 'conda env create -f environment.yml' is executed (see later)

  Conda reads the environment.yml file and creates a new environment based on the specifications in that file.

  The environment will have the name given by the name key in the YAML file i.e. 'neuron'.

* For setting up Jupyter Notebook (interactive code notebooks): https://jupyter.org/install
